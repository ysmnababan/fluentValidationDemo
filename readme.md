Fluent Validation Demo 

This is simple demo for Fluent Validation. 
There are several approaches for doing this:

Manual validation
Automatic validation (using the ASP.NET validation pipeline)
Automatic validation (using a filter)

this is automatic validation using asp.net pipeline with the drawback that it can implement async function.
So for simple validation, please try to implement Data Annotation first.
